**Make sure to accept the terms in the Azure Subscription or the deployment may fail**

**By default the user api_user with a password of "vpn123" is created.**

**Use additional API calls to limit the source API to known GUI client IP addresses to limit access to the API.**

Update to more complex credentials for production use!
